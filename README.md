## Gotchas	

- For github pages to work on an [arbitrary route](https://wednesday-solutions.github.io/react-template/) we have the used some workarounds.
For production builds deployed directly on `/` you need to make the following changes
  1. [publicPath: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/react-template/' : '/'](https://github.com/wednesday-solutions/react-template/blob/master/internals/webpack/webpack.base.babel.js#L29)
   should be: ```publicPath: '/'	```
  2. [relativePaths: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'](https://github.com/wednesday-solutions/react-template/blob/master/internals/webpack/webpack.prod.babel.js#L85)
  should be: ```relativePaths: false,```
  2. [const history = createBrowserHistory({ basename: baseUrl });](https://github.com/wednesday-solutions/react-template/blob/master/app/utils/history.js#L3)
  should be:  ```const history = createBrowserHistory();```
